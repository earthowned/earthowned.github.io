## What are Package Managers?
Downloading software through GUI install wizards, or compiling by source is inefficient in the software engineer industry. Knowing how to manage software is a powerful skill in order to become a competent software developer. This is where Package Managers come in. 

Package Managers help us to add, remove, and update installed software from a centralized repository. Software installed by a package manager are bundled in **packages**. Packages contain the software you wanted to install **plus** any other software that is needed for you program to work. These added pieces of software are known as **dependencies**. 

Here is a list of some well-know package managers you may encounter in your career:

|APK|Package manager for Alpine Linux|
|Homebrew |Package Manager for macOS systems|
|Chocolatey |Open-source package manager for Windows systems|
|pip |Package manager for Python modules|
|npm |Package manager for Node.js environment|

In this internship you would be mostly using npm and your operating system of choice package manager.
