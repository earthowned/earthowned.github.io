# First Steps

# The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps for becoming part of PlanetFarms program at Earthowned! These first steps are a process to prove that you have learned the foundational skills before you can progress to working on harder projects with larger teams. Consider this to be the interview for the program.

If you are selected after completing the steps, you will be officially invited to join the PlanetFarms team!

# The Steps
Social coding is a huge part of any open source and collaborative project, and the Open Learning Exchange (OLE) is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about Markdown, Docker, Git, GitHub, GitHub issues, GitHub pull requests, etc. You will also be introduced to OLE’s digital library that hosts the learning materials – [Planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet).

Because these steps are simple, we expect high-quality work, which may take a longer time. We want to see that you are capable of using or learning how to use these tools (writing good GitHub issues, creating pull requests, using Markdown and Docker, etc.). These steps may seem easy, but we want you to impress us with good GitHub etiquette and quality Markdown. The bare minimum would be to just passively follow the steps; you should do further reading about the tools languages we use so you can further your understanding and relieve confusion if you're unclear about how something works. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!** The GitHub and Markdown skills you practice here are very important for both this program and a future software development career.

## Step 1 - Github

1. Log into your [GitHub account](https://github.com/) then watch [planetfarms.github.io repo](https://github.com/earthowned/planetfarms.github.io) and Follow [Dogi](https://github.com/dogi) and [Lmmrssa](https://github.com/lmmrssa) on GitHub.

  In GitHub, we "[Watch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories)" organization repositories and ["Follow" (https://help.github.com/en/articles/following-people) individuals. Look for the "Watch" button at the top right of the page when you are in a repository.  Also, follow each other to see what others in the group are doing.

2. Using [GitHub](github.md)

## Step 2 - Markdown

Make sure that you've linked to your github.io and pull request in the chat.

**NOTE**: The `raw.githack` link is case sensitive to your username. 

> Once you complete Step 2 you will have:

* **1** Pull request made

Check your progress [here](trackprogress.md)

## Step 3 - Planetfarms

There are 3 sub-steps in this step:

1. [PlanetFarms](#!./pages/micromaster/planetfarms.md)

## Step 5 - Create Issues

Improve the PlanetFarms documentation and create at least **2 issues** and **pull request**.

> Once you complete Step 5 you will have:

* **2** new pull request made

Check your progress [here](trackprogress.md)

## Step 6 - Using Earthowned

1. This step includes the [Earthowned Manual](../manual/earthowned.md), which explains different features and usage of Planet system.

2. You should search for Courses and Library under Planetfarms  and take those Courses and Library.

3. Create at least **4 issues** and **pull request** to improve Planetfarms manual.

> Once you complete Step 7 you will have:

Check your progress [here](trackprogress.md)

## Step 9 - Join the team

Next thing is to post a screenshot of your completed progress to the  chat. Click [here](trackprogress.md) to find your completed progress.
Creat a Pull Request to add yourself [team.md](team.md). Then message us ("@lmmrssa" and "@dogi") at chat and ask about setting up a meeting so you can become a part of the team as soon as possible.
